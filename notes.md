# Talk

Given at 10:15 and 3:15 on Friday, February the 18th.

## welcome

hi. I'm Nat Welch. Nick asked me to talk a little about building a personal online portfolio.

## Examples

So before we get too far into this, I figured I'd go through some examples, point out some problems and some good things.

### Dave

A pretty solid site, but you need to click to get detailed information about the cool stuff he has done.

### Chris

There is a lot of text on the landing page. The first paragraph tells us very little beyond the scope of the site.

### Henry

Almost too minimalistic. What has he done? Where does he work? Why should I contact him in the first place?

### Nat

similar to dave's. A few more links to places where you can find me.

### Jeannie

Jeannie is a graphic designer, and as such has a rotating banner showing off her work. Promote what makes you, you. In this case it's jeannie's graphic design work, so she shows you. She also tells us how recent the data is (which can be good or bad).

### Nat's Github

This is my github page, what is nice about this is it's easy to maintain. The lack of color is kind of annoying, but it lists projects I am working on. This is probably closest to what you want.

## Basic HTML / example

You can really build a personal webpage how ever you like. Here is probably the least you want to put up. Notice it has your name, a little about you, and some projects you have done that you are interested. I didn't link the projects to anything, but it's a really good idea to link them to at least a screen shot, or maybe a zipfile or working demo. Or the best solution, all three. You can always use this as an excuse to learn css or you can just leave it plain.

## options

I'm going to cover two easy free ways to put your website on the internet. There are lots others, such as getting shared hosting or setting up an ec2 micro instance.

### CSC

The first is your csc user page. This is great because it's hosted on the departments servers and can run PHP, if that is something you are interested in. The downside is after a year from when you have graduated, they delete it.

Here is how you create it. index.html is the page browsers will look for.

### GitHub Pages.

This requires a little more work. First you will need a GitHub account. Then you will need to create a project named username.github.com. Then whatever static content you commit to the project will be hosted at http://username.github.com.

They actually give you directions on how to do this once you create the repo.

## Closing.

The whole point of having a portfolio is to get out there. It's something you want to maintain over time because employers will want code examples. The idea is to maintain a presence online where people can get a glimpse of you. It doesn't have to be much, but keep it up to date. Show the world that you are active in your field outside of work. People want to know that you are capable of growth even when not forced by your employer.
